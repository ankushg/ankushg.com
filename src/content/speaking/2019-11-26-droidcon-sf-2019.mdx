Learn how Quizlet uses Kotlin Multiplatform to build iOS, Android, and web learning experiences for over 50 million users per month.

By pinpointing the best areas of our codebase to share (and skipping over many others), Quizlet was able to use Kotlin Multiplatform to share the “secret sauce” of our product.

We did this without forcing our Android, iOS, and Web clients to follow a rigid, predetermined architecture. You'll hear Quizlet's journey getting Kotlin Multiplatform into production, how it compares to other approaches of sharing code, and (most importantly) lessons about shared code that we learned along the way.
